# 2D Ray Tracer

## Overview

As my senior project for my Software Engineering degree, I developed a real-time 2D ray tracer to explore and adapt advanced 3D rendering techniques to a 2D environment. The primary goal was to deepen my understanding of GPU programming and rendering pipelines.

## Technologies Used
C++, OpenGL, GLSL

## Features & Technologies
<div style={{paddingLeft: '2rem'}}>
- **Achieved Real-Time Performance:** Implemented cone tracing as an optimization to approximate light spread and soft shadows, drastically reducing the number of rays required for real-time rendering.
- **Efficient Lighting with Deferred Shading:** Developed a deferred shading pipeline to decouple geometry and lighting calculations, enabling the efficient handling of multiple dynamic light sources.
- **GPU-Accelerated Calculations:** Leveraged compute shaders to parallelize ray and cone calculations on the GPU, which was critical for achieving real-time performance.
- **Interactive Lighting:** The mouse cursor acts as a dynamic light source, allowing for real-time interaction with the scene.

## Reflection

This project was a foundational experience in my graphics programming journey. It taught me the importance of optimization, the fundamentals of GPU programming, and the design of modular rendering pipelines. 

If I were to revisit this project, I would explore more advanced topics such as global illumination and refractions to further enhance the realism of the 2D rendering.
