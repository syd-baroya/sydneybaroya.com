# 2D Ray Tracer
## Overview

In 2019, as my senior project for my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, I built a **real-time 2D ray tracer**. The goal was to explore rendering techniques typically applied in 3D graphics and adapt them to a 2D environment for learning and experimentation.

## Technical Breakdown
<div style={{paddingLeft: '2rem'}}>
- **Languages & Tools**: C++, OpenGL, GLSL

- **Cone Tracing**:
  Instead of tracing infinitely thin rays, I implemented cone tracing to approximate light spread and soft shadows. 
  This significantly reduced the number of rays needed and improved performance.

- **Deferred Shader**:
  Used a deferred shading pipeline to separate geometry rendering from lighting calculations,  
  making it easier to handle multiple light interactions.

- **Compute Shader**:
  Parallelized the ray/cone calculations using compute shaders, taking advantage of the GPU for real-time performance.

- **Frame Buffer**:
  Implemented a frame buffer for post-processing effects and to efficiently combine render passes.

- **Interactive Light Source**:
  The mouse cursor was used as the main light emitter, allowing interactivity and dynamic illumination.

## Reflection

This project was a major milestone in my journey into graphics programming. While 2D may seem simple compared to 3D, implementing a ray tracer with real-time performance taught me critical lessons:
<div style={{paddingLeft: '2rem'}}>

- The importance of optimization (cone tracing vs brute-force rays)  
- GPU programming fundamentals with compute shaders  
- Designing a modular rendering pipeline (deferred shading, frame buffers)  
- How small changes in algorithms can drastically affect both performance and visual quality
