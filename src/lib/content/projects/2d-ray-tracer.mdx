# Real-time Body Tracking & Projection Mapping in the Interactive Arts

## Overview
This project was the centerpiece of my Master's thesis, exploring how **real-time body tracking** and **projection mapping** can transform interactive art experiences. The installation invited participants to step into a space where their movements generated dynamic, evolving visuals projected onto large-scale surfaces, blurring the line between audience and performer.  

The work combined:
- Real-time computer vision and body tracking  
- Generative projection mapping  
- An emphasis on immersive, participatory art

## Exhibition History8

### Eye of Metamorphosis — Burning Man 2019
- **Location:** Black Rock City, Nevada  
- **Description:** Premiered as a large-scale art installation on the playa. Participants became part of a surreal visual ecosystem where their movements caused projected imagery to shift, transform, and react in real time.  
- **Impact:** Thousands of festival-goers engaged with the piece over the week, many returning multiple times for the evolving experience.

### Delfines de San Carlos 2020: Un Proyecto de Esperanza
- **Location:** San Carlos, Mexico  
- **Description:** Adapted for a community art event centered on hope and resilience. The installation was redesigned for a smaller venue, incorporating local cultural motifs into the projected visuals.  
- **Impact:** Brought immersive digital art to a new cultural context, connecting themes of transformation with the local audience.

## Reflection
This project taught me how interactive media can transcend technology to create **shared, transformative experiences**. From the expansive desert of Burning Man to a local cultural festival in Mexico, the core idea of blending movement, technology, and art adapted to vastly different contexts while preserving its essence of connection and wonder.

## Customizing Layout in MDX

Here are examples of how you can customize the position of components and text within your MDX files using plain CSS, MUI Stack, and MUI Grid.

### 1. Using Plain CSS

You can use a simple `div` with inline styles or a class name for basic positioning. For more complex layouts, consider defining CSS classes in your global stylesheets (`src/styles/globals.css` or a module CSS file).

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-around', alignItems: 'center', border: '1px solid #ccc', padding: '10px', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
  <p style={{ margin: 0 }}>Left Aligned Text</p>
  <p style={{ margin: 0 }}>Center Aligned Text</p>
  <p style={{ margin: 0 }}>Right Aligned Text</p>
</div>

### 2. Using MUI Stack

`Stack` is ideal for one-dimensional layouts (either row or column). It provides spacing and alignment utilities.

<Stack direction="row" spacing={2} sx={{ border: '1px solid #ccc', padding: '10px', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
</Stack>

<Stack spacing={1} sx={{ border: '1px solid #ccc', padding: '10px', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
  <div>Vertical Item A</div>
  <div>Vertical Item B</div>
  <div>Vertical Item C</div>
</Stack>

### 3. Using MUI Grid

`Grid` is a powerful 2D layout system based on CSS Grid. It's excellent for creating responsive, complex layouts.

<Grid container spacing={2} sx={{ border: '1px solid #ccc', padding: '10px' }}>
  <Grid item xs={12} sm={6} md={4}>
    <div style={{ background: '#e0e0e0', padding: '10px', textAlign: 'center' }}>Column 1 (xs=12, sm=6, md=4)</div>
  </Grid>
  <Grid item xs={12} sm={6} md={4}>
    <div style={{ background: '#e0e0e0', padding: '10px', textAlign: 'center' }}>Column 2 (xs=12, sm=6, md=4)</div>
  </Grid>
  <Grid item xs={12} sm={12} md={4}>
    <div style={{ background: '#e0e0e0', padding: '10px', textAlign: 'center' }}>Column 3 (xs=12, sm=12, md=4)</div>
  </Grid>
</Grid>
