# Real-time Body Tracking & Projection Mapping in the Interactive Arts
## Overview
This project was the centerpiece of my Master's thesis, exploring how **real-time body tracking** and **projection mapping** can transform interactive art experiences. Using depth-sensing cameras and custom software, the installation invited participants to step into a space where their movements generated dynamic, evolving visuals projected onto large-scale surfaces, blurring the line between audience and performer.  

The work combined:
- Real-time computer vision and body tracking  
- Generative projection mapping  
- An emphasis on immersive, participatory art

The work culminated in my master’s thesis and was exhibited in two major interactive art installations: Eye of Metamorphosis at Burning Man 2019, and Delfines de San Carlos: Un Proyecto de Esperanza in 2020.

## Exhibition History

### Eye of Metamorphosis — Burning Man 2019
- **Location:** Black Rock City, Nevada  
- **Description:** Premiered as a large-scale art installation on the playa. Participants became part of a surreal visual ecosystem where their movements caused projected imagery to shift, transform, and react in real time.  
- **Impact:** Thousands of festival-goers engaged with the piece over the week, many returning multiple times for the evolving experience.

### Delfines de San Carlos 2020: Un Proyecto de Esperanza
- **Location:** San Carlos, Mexico  
- **Description:** Adapted for a community art event centered on hope and resilience. The installation was redesigned using C# and Unity.  
- **Impact:** Brought immersive digital art to a new cultural context, connecting themes of transformation with the local audience.
