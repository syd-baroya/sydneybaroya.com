# Real-time Body Tracking & Projection Mapping in the Interactive Arts
## Overview
This project was the centerpiece of my Master's thesis, exploring how to improve **real-time body tracking** and **projection mapping** to be more accurate and precise, to transform interactive art experiences. Using depth-sensing cameras and custom software, the installation invited participants to step into a space where their movements generated dynamic, evolving visuals projected onto large-scale surfaces, blurring the line between audience and performer.  

The work culminated in my master’s thesis and was exhibited in two major interactive art installations: Eye of Metamorphosis at Burning Man 2019, and Delfines de San Carlos: Un Proyecto de Esperanza in 2020.

    ### Eye of Metamorphosis — Burning Man 2019

            <div style={{paddingLeft: '2rem'}}>
                - **Location:** Black Rock City, Nevada  
                - **Description:** Premiered as a large-scale art installation on the playa. Participants became part of a surreal visual ecosystem where their movements caused projected imagery to shift, transform, and react in real time. For the art installation, my team and I created giant eyeball made out epoxy and resin for the projector, laptop, and Kinect to be held inside of. This was to enhance its appeasibility as an art installation and to help protect it from the elements. This used the main project, developed in C++ and OpenGL, with one Microsoft Kinect.

    ### Delfines de San Carlos 2020: Un Proyecto de Esperanza
    <Grid container spacing={2}>
    <Grid item xs={12} lg={4}>
        <div style={{paddingLeft: '2rem'}}>
            - **Location:** San Carlos, Mexico  
            - **Description:** A community art event created by Lucia Apodaca and attended by the Mayor of Guaymas Comisario of San Carlos. The event included art installations of various dolphin statues designed by local artists. Apodaca wanted projections mapped to a dolphin statue that could be changed by the audience. In order to use certain assets, I decided to adapt the code to use Unity and C#, keeping the logic of the code the same. The body tracking and gesture recognition software stayed similar from the original project while the projection mapping and shaders were updated.
