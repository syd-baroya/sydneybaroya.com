# OpenGL Project Template

## Overview

Frustrated with bloated and monolithic starter code during my studies, I created this OpenGL project template to streamline the development of new graphics applications. It provides a clean, modular, and easy-to-build foundation for any new OpenGL project.

## Technologies Used
C++, OpenGL, GLSL, CMake, vcpkg

## Features & Technologies
- **Modular Architecture:** A clean and organized project structure separates source files, shaders, and external dependencies, making the codebase easy to navigate and maintain.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Utilizes CMake to support builds on Windows, macOS, and Linux with minimal setup, ensuring the project is accessible to a wide range of developers.
- **Simplified Dependency Management:** Integrates vcpkg to automate the inclusion of essential libraries like GLFW, GLAD, and GLM, significantly reducing project setup time.
- **GitHub Template:** The repository is configured as a GitHub template, allowing anyone to bootstrap a new OpenGL project with a single click.

## Reflection
This template embodies my commitment to good software engineering practices and developer ergonomics. It has personally saved me countless hours of setup and configuration, and I hope it can do the same for other developers. I plan to maintain and expand it with more advanced features like a material system and a more robust renderer.
