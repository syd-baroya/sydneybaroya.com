# OpenGL Project Template
## Overview

During my bachelor’s degree, I found that computer graphics lab starter code was often bloated or tangled in a single file, making them hard to follow and reuse. So, I created this **OpenGL project template** to streamline future work—clean, modular, and easy to build.

The repository's README.md has clear build instructions if you'd like try it for yourself! I've attached the link below. Once run, the window will show a simple scene with texutred plane, a spinning textured pyramid, an otter loaded in from a .dae file, and a cube as the light source. The user can also use the W, A, S, D, E, C, and Z keys to interact with the scene and ESC key to close the window.

## Key Features
<div style={{paddingLeft: '2rem'}}>
- **Modular project structure**—clear folder separation for source files, shaders, and external dependencies
- **Cross-platform builds with CMake**—works on Windows, macOS, and Linux with minimal setup
- **Dependency management via vcpkg**—automates inclusion of libraries like GLFW, GLAD, GLM, and stb_image
- **Shader organization**—keeps `.vert` and `.frag` files neatly in a `resources/` directory
- **Easy project instantiation**—use it as a GitHub template or copy it locally to kickstart new OpenGL apps
</div>

## Technical Breakdown
<div style={{paddingLeft: '2rem'}}>

- **Project Structure**
<div style={{paddingLeft: '2rem'}}>
  - `src/`: Core application code  
  - `ext/`: Bundled header-only libraries (e.g., `stb_image.h`)  
  - `resources/`: Shaders and assets  
  - `CMakeLists.txt` and `CMakePresets.json`: Build config for native and preset-based builds  
  - `vcpkg.json`: Defines and manages external dependencies
</div>
- **Build System with CMake**  
  Uses CMake presets to simplify configuration:
<div style={{paddingLeft: '2rem'}}>
  - `windows-vcpkg`: Generates `.sln` for Visual Studio  
  - `macos-vcpkg` (and others): Builds on other platforms  
  - Supports cross-platform development with unified tooling
</div>
- **Vcpkg Integration**  
  Automatically fetches and installs essential graphics libraries using vcpkg. Just clone, configure, and build.
- **Clean Shader Workflow**  
  Organizes shaders and assets for easier editing and cleaner renders.

## Reflection

This template reflects my commitment to **developer ergonomics and scalability**. Now, I can instantly bootstrap new OpenGL projects without manually configuring windowing, loading libraries, or organizing code. I would have enjoyed using this as a student and definitely appreciate it now as a professional developer.

Just let me know how else I can expand on it!
