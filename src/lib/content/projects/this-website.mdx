# Building My Portfolio

## Overview
A deep dive into the technical choices and challenges behind building this very website. Built with Next.js, it features custom Three.js integrations for interactive 3D elements, all implemented without the use of `react-three-fiber`. This approach allowed for fine-grained control over the Three.js lifecycle and direct manipulation of the WebGL context.

## Technologies Used
ThreeJS, GLSL, ReactJS, MDX

## Features & Technologies
- **Custom Three.js Setup:** Integrating Three.js directly into a React/Next.js environment, managing scene, camera, renderer, and animation loops manually.
- **Performance Optimization:** Strategies for maintaining smooth animations and interactions while handling complex 3D scenes.
- **Shader Development:** Custom GLSL shaders for unique visual effects.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the 3D experiences adapt seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.

A more in-depth technical breakdown, including code examples and detailed explanations of the challenges faced and solutions implemented, will be available in a future blog post. Stay tuned!
