# Shader Playground â€” Still in work
## Overview

This project aims to bridge desktop OpenGL shader work with web-based experiences. I created **Shader Playground** to allow writing, visualizing, and testing shaders in both native C++ environments and directly in the browser via WebGL.

## Motivation

During shader development, switching between native development setups and web previews felt disconnected. Shader Playground solves that by offering a unified codebase where you can:
<div style={{paddingLeft: '2rem'}}>
- Develop shader code in a native OpenGL context for deep debugging  
- Preview the same shaders instantly online via WebGL  
- Streamline creative experimentation and accessibility  
</div>

## Project Structure & Features

<div style={{paddingLeft: '2rem'}}>
- **`cpp-viewer`:** A desktop OpenGL application that runs GLSL shaders locally, helping with iteration and debugging.
- **`web-viewer`:** A browser-based, WebGL-powered viewer that renders the same shaders live on your site.
- **Shared folders:** 
<div style={{paddingLeft: '2rem'}}>
  - `shaders/` for core GLSL files  
  - `assets/` for textures or models  
  - Utility scripts (e.g., asset syncing) kept in `scripts/`
</div>
- **Developer workflow:** Modify shaders once and see them render both locally and in your browser with minimal setup.
</div>

## Technical Highlights

<div style={{paddingLeft: '2rem'}}>
- Dual rendering pipelines: leveraging both OpenGL and WebGL seamlessly  
- Structured codebase to prevent duplication and enable reuse  
- Simple utility scripts to sync assets/shaders between project components  
- Ideal for easing shader development while maintaining accessibility for web audiences
</div>

## Reflection

Shader Playground reflects a desire for fluid shader development across platforms. It balances the fidelity and speed of native OpenGL with the broader reach of WebGL and the web platform. Whether you're a solo developer or building interactive demos, this framework simplifies testing and sharing shader work.
