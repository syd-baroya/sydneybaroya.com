# Shader Playground

## Overview

Shader Playground is a tool designed to bridge the gap between native OpenGL and web-based Three.js shader development. It provides a unified environment for writing, visualizing, and testing shaders, enabling developers to seamlessly transition between the two platforms.

## Technologies Used
C++, OpenGL, GLSL, JavaScript, ThreeJS, React, NextJS

## Motivation

This project was born from my experience working with both OpenGL in academia and Three.js in a professional setting. I wanted a way to easily translate my OpenGL shaders to the web to showcase them in my portfolio, and to refresh my OpenGL skills by re-implementing Three.js shaders in a native environment.

## Current Status & Future Goals

This project is currently under active development. The foundational elements are in place, allowing for basic shader translation and visualization. 

My future goals for this project include:
<div style={{paddingLeft: '2rem'}}>
- Implementing a more robust live-reloading system for a faster development workflow.
- Building a more comprehensive UI for tweaking shader parameters in real-time.
- Expanding the library of included shaders and effects.

## Shaders
### Water Shader
A shader that mimics the look and movement of the ocean. Inspired by the waves of Grandview Beach in San Diego during a sunset surf.
